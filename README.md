# Greedy Graph Coloring Algorithm

This project implements a greedy graph coloring algorithm using C++. The algorithm assigns colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Description

The algorithm uses a greedy approach to color the graph efficiently. It assigns the smallest possible color to each vertex, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

## Usage

To run the program, use a C++ compiler. Below is an example of how to compile and run the program using g++:
Please enter total number of vertices and edges:
4 5

Enter edge vertices of edge 1 : 1 2
Enter edge vertices of edge 2 : 2 3
Enter edge vertices of edge 3 : 3 4
Enter edge vertices of edge 4 : 4 1
Enter edge vertices of edge 5 : 2 4

Output:
Vertex 1 is coloured 1
Vertex 2 is coloured 2
Vertex 3 is coloured 1
Vertex 4 is coloured 3
